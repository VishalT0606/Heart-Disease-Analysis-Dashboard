❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard – Executive Summary

🧭 Objective

To analyze key medical and demographic factors influencing heart disease risk using interactive visual analytics.
The dashboard helps identify high-risk groups, understand symptom/condition patterns, and support data-driven decision-making for preventive healthcare strategies.🔍 Key Insights

✅ Overall Dataset Metrics

Total Records Analyzed: 303 patients

Heart Disease Cases: 165 (Majority class)

No Heart Disease: 138

Gender Split: Male cases significantly higher than female

Age Range: 29–77 years, with higher cases in older groups

📌 Insight: Heart disease prevalence increases sharply with age and is more common among males.

🧬 Clinical Factor Analysis
Blood Pressure (Resting BP)

Patients with heart disease show higher resting BP on average.

Majority of heart disease cases fall in the 130–150 mmHg range.

📌 Action Point: Patients with elevated BP should be prioritized for monitoring.

Cholesterol Levels

Many heart disease patients have cholesterol between 200–300 mg/dL.

A noticeable cluster of very high cholesterol values seen among diseased patients.

📌 Insight: Cholesterol remains a strong indicator of cardiovascular risk.

Chest Pain Type

Asymptomatic (Type 4) chest pain shows the highest number of heart disease cases.

Typical angina has fewer disease outcomes.

📌 Insight: Symptomless patients may still be at high risk, requiring proactive screening.

🚶 Lifestyle & Medical Indicators
Fasting Blood Sugar

Patients with FBS > 120 mg/dL show a moderately higher heart disease probability.

Exercise-Induced Angina

Heart disease patients display significantly more exercise-induced angina cases.

Oldpeak (ST Depression)

Higher Oldpeak values correspond with increased disease prevalence.

📌 Insight: ST depression during exercise is a strong diagnostic signal.

🩺 ECG & Heart Rate Analysis
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

Lower maximum HR achieved is common among heart disease patients.

Healthy patients typically reached higher HR zones.

Resting ECG Results

Abnormal ECG results appear more often in diseased patients.

🗺️ Demographic & Age Group Patterns
Age Group Breakdown

Heart disease probability rises sharply after age 45.

55–65 year bracket contributes the highest number of diseased cases.

Gender Distribution

Males show nearly double the number of heart disease cases compared to females.

📌 Insight: Preventive interventions should target middle-aged and senior male groups.

📈 Conclusion & Strategic Recommendations

Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, Oldpeak, and chest pain type are the strongest risk indicators.

Screening programs should prioritize patients above 45, especially males with high cholesterol & BP.

Encourage lifestyle modifications for patients with exercise-induced angina or abnormal ECG.

Develop early-warning tools using these key factors to reduce late diagnosis.

Further analysis with a larger dataset may improve prediction accuracy and broaden insights.
